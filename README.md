# BnS-FasterLoading-Plugin 🧙‍♂️
## A Blade and Soul (UE4) plugin that makes loading faster by unlimiting the fps during loading screens.
All fps limits are restored after loading is complete.  (Fortunately the game does this for us 😎)

Very noticeable when alt tabbing during loading screens with a background fps limit on.

With this plugin you can limit your fps as low as you want to autofarm and still have fast loading screens.
